Looks like there are more issues to fix. It may be easier to enable the php-cs-fixer rule that adds the `?` for you, to catch them all.

I am writing this on an airport before boarding my plane, so just mentioning that because I will get back to this :nerd_face:

Looks like there are more downstream fixes that are needed first, to get this PR to pass.

I've pushed some extra changes to fix most of the remaining issues. The deprecations in `Http\Client\Common\HttpMethodsClient` are fixed upstream but not yet releases. The http mock client still needs changes for this deprecation. I'm going to merge this PR for now as our code is deprecation free on php 8.4
