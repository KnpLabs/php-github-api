Thanks for the PR @GrahamCampbell! So in a nutshell this would mean dropping httplug v1 support as v2 already supports psr-18?

Can we also remove the other bc layers then? https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api/blob/b3a72529a029c0e10f7944e0c32920a0ce3843d5/lib/Github/HttpClient/Plugin/PathPrepend.php#L15

Can you also check the failing tests? Thanks!
