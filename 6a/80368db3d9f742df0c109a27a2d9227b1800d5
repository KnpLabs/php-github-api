I wonder if we should add strict typing to all the files in 3.x?

I think that could be a next step indeed. I'm preping a PR to set all docblocks correctly in the 2.x branch, which will allow us to use an automatic tool to convert these to typehints in v3.

Could be risky if there are mistakes in the doc. I am in the process of doing something similar for the GitLab client https://github.com/m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api, however I won't add any scalar types to anything in the Api namespace for fear of breaking stuff. I will, however add strict typing everywhere, and scalar typehints everywhere else in that package. ;)

Yes, that does mean that the docblocks should be correct. Something we can check but it's not a must for me, if we indeed have typehints in the other parts and enable strict typing it would a step forward!
