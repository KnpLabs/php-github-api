# PHP GitHub API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api)
[![StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/3948501/shield?style=flat)](https://styleci.io/repos/3948501)

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for GitHub API, written with PHP5.

Uses [GitHub API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3/). The object API is very similar to the RESTful API.

## Features

* Follows PSR-0 conventions and coding standard: autoload friendly
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested and documented

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.4
* (optional) [php-httplug/guzzle5-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle5-adapter) to use with a guzzle 5 http client
* (optional) [php-httplug/guzzle6-adapter](https://github.com/php-http/guzzle6-adapter) to use with a guzzle 6 http client

## Autoload

The first step to use `php-github-api` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then run the following command to require the library:
```bash
$ php composer.phar require knplabs/github-api
```

> `php-github-api` follows the PSR-4 convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate `php-github-api` classes loading in your own autoloader.

## Using Laravel?

[Laravel GitHub](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-GitHub) by [Graham Campbell](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell) might interest you.

## Basic usage of `php-github-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Github\Client(
    new \Github\HttpClient\HttplugClient(
        new \Http\Adapter\Guzzle6\Client( // Only available when you require the php-httplug/guzzle6-adapter lib
            new \GuzzleHttp\Client()
        ),
        new \Github\Factory\RequestFactory()
    )
);

$users = $client->api('user')->all();
```

From `$client` object, you can access to all GitHub.
