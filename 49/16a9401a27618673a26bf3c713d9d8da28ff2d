When do you think this can be merged?
Change is very tiny, but the issue is causing team members not beeing able to create repos, since they are only allowed to create private ones

Would be really happy to see this merged - thanks in advance! :)

Hi @mruell, the change itself looks good! Can you just fix the tests? Thanks!
