Okey, Then I'll remove the `AbstractApi::$perPage`.

Thank you for the feedback

oops, Im wrong again.

The `ResultPager` is using `AbstractApi::$perPage`. I've updated the integration tests and added a small comment.

Yes, the resultpager is now the "main" point of entry for paginating results so that's the why the `perPage` property is not accessable anymore for the api classes. But the resultpager still use this property to do it's job.

See #907 for more context on this.

Thanks for the extra comment and fixed tests!
