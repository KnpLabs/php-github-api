Thanks! I looked for tests, and for CONTRIBUTING.md/code_style.*, but I haven't found any (I should've checked by myself, instead of relying on my IDE ðŸ˜–).

I added the return type too. I'm not sure if I should remove the "redundant" types in the DOC, my IDE is showing a warning ðŸ˜¶"Update PHPDoc comment - Argument type do not match the declared type" (PHPStorm).

I'm not sure if my tests are what you wanted, I can't run them at all (and I don't have much time to look into it).
