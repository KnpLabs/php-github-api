Thanks! I just wanted to submit a pull request for this. But saw yours.

There is one more minor issue at line 48:
`$github = new Github\Client($builder, 'machine-man-preview');`

Here `$builder` variable is referenced, but it is not initiated. We can add this line before line 48:

`$builder = new Builder(new GuzzleHttp\Client());`

and include: `use Github\HttpClient\Builder;`
