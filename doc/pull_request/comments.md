## Pull Requests / Review Comments API
[Back to the "Pull Requests API"](../pull_requests.md) | [Back to the navigation](../README.md)

Review Comments are comments on a portion of the unified diff. These are separate from Commit Comments (which
are applied directly to a commit, outside of the Pull Request view), and Issue Comments (which do not reference
a portion of the unified diff).
