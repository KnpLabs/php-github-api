```

#### Update a gist

You can update ``description``.

```php
$data = array(
    'description' => 'This is new description'
);

$gist = $github->api('gists')->update(1234, $data);
```

You can update ``content`` of a previous file's version.

```php
$data = array(
    'files' => array(
        'filename.txt' => array(
            'content' => 'updated txt file content'
        ),
    ),
);
$gist = $github->api('gists')->update(1234, $data);
```

You can update the ``filename`` of a previous file's version.

```php
$data = array(
    'files' => array(
        'filename.txt' => array(
            'filename' => 'new-filename.txt'
        ),
    ),
);
$gist = $github->api('gists')->update(1234, $data);
```

You can add a new file to the gist.

```php
$data = array(
    'files' => array(
        'new-filename.php' => array(
            'content' => 'a new file content'
        ),
    ),
);
$gist = $github->api('gists')->update(1234, $data);
```

You can remove a file from the gist.

```php
$data = array(
    'files' => array(
        'filename.txt' => null,
    ),
);
$gist = $github->api('gists')->update(1234, $data);
```
