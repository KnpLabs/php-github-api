## Enterprise API
[Back to the navigation](index.md)

Provides information about a GitHub Enterprise installation. Wraps [GitHub Enterprise API](http://developer.github.com/v3/enterprise/).

In order to configure the client to point to a GitHub Enterprise installation, do the following:

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new \Github\Client();

// Set the URL of your GitHub Enterprise installation
$client->setEnterpriseUrl('https://ghe.host');

// Use the client as you would ordinarily
$repositories = $client->api('user')->repositories('ornicar');
```

To use the Stats and License APIs, you will need to authenticate using a GitHub Enterprise site admin account.
