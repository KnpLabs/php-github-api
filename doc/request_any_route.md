## Request any Route
[Back to the navigation](index.md)

The method you need does not exist yet? You can access any GitHub route by using the "get" and "post" methods.
For example:

```php
$client   = new Github\Client();
$response = $client->getHttpClient()->get('repos/KnpLabs/php-github-api');
$repo     = Github\HttpClient\Message\ResponseMediator::getContent($response);
```

Returns an array describing the "php-github-api" repository.
