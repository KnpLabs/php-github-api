# AI-Assisted Development Context: PHP ArgoCD API Client

This document provides context on the development process of this PHP client for the ArgoCD API, which was significantly assisted by an AI agent named Jules.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to refactor an existing PHP client library originally designed for the GitHub API (KnpLabs/php-github-api) and adapt it to become a fully functional client for the ArgoCD REST API.

## Development Process

The development process involved a collaborative effort between a human developer and the AI agent, Jules. Key aspects of this process include:

*   **Initial Request:** The human developer provided an issue statement outlining the need to fork the GitHub library, study its structure, and then refactor it to implement ArgoCD's OpenAPI specification (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/master/assets/swagger.json`).
*   **Codebase Analysis:** Jules explored the existing GitHub client's codebase using tools to list files and read their content to understand its architecture and patterns.
*   **OpenAPI Analysis:** Jules fetched and analyzed the ArgoCD OpenAPI specification to understand its endpoints, data structures, and service organization.
*   **Planning:** Based on the analysis, Jules created a detailed, multi-step plan to execute the refactoring. This plan was reviewed and approved by the human developer.
*   **Iterative Implementation:** Jules executed the plan step-by-step by delegating specific, actionable tasks to a "Worker" agent. These tasks included:
    *   Creating new directory structures.
    *   Initializing `composer.json` and managing dependencies.
    *   Adapting core client classes (`Client.php`, `HttpClient/Builder.php`, `Api/AbstractApi.php`).
    *   Implementing exception handling.
    *   Generating PHP model classes based on OpenAPI definitions.
    *   Implementing API service classes (e.g., `SessionService.php`, `AccountService.php`) with methods corresponding to ArgoCD API operations.
*   **Feedback Incorporation:** The human developer provided feedback at various stages (e.g., on directory structure, PHP version constraints), and Jules updated the plan and execution accordingly.

## Current State

As of the last AI interaction, the project has achieved the following:

*   **Core Infrastructure:** A foundational client structure is in place, including the main `Client` class, HTTP client builder, abstract API class, and basic exception handling.
*   **Authentication:** The client can authenticate against an ArgoCD instance by exchanging username/password for a bearer token (via `SessionService`) or by using a pre-existing token.
*   **Initial API Services:**
    *   `SessionService`: Implemented for login, logout, and user info.
    *   `AccountService`: Implemented for managing accounts and tokens.
*   **Data Models:** PHP model classes corresponding to the implemented services' request/response structures have been created.
*   **Project Configuration:** `composer.json` has been set up, and the project directory has been structured. The ArgoCD OpenAPI specification has been added to `reference/argocd_swagger.json`.

Further development will involve implementing the remaining ArgoCD API services (like the extensive `ApplicationService`), adding comprehensive unit tests, and refining documentation.

## Acknowledgements

*   The initial structure and patterns were derived from the excellent [KnpLabs/php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api) library.
*   The target API is [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and its OpenAPI specification was used as the blueprint for API implementation.
