# AI-Assisted Development Context: PHP ArgoCD API Client

This document provides context on the development process of this PHP client for the ArgoCD API, which was significantly assisted by an AI agent named Jules.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to refactor an existing PHP client library originally designed for the GitHub API (KnpLabs/php-github-api) and adapt it to become a fully functional client for the ArgoCD REST API.

## Development Process

The development process involved a collaborative effort between a human developer and the AI agent, Jules. Key aspects of this process include:

*   **Initial Request:** The human developer provided an issue statement outlining the need to fork the GitHub library, study its structure, and then refactor it to implement ArgoCD's OpenAPI specification (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/master/assets/swagger.json`).
*   **Codebase Analysis:** Jules explored the existing GitHub client's codebase using tools to list files and read their content to understand its architecture and patterns.
*   **OpenAPI Analysis:** Jules fetched and analyzed the ArgoCD OpenAPI specification to understand its endpoints, data structures, and service organization.
*   **Planning:** Based on the analysis, Jules created a detailed, multi-step plan to execute the refactoring. This plan was reviewed and approved by the human developer.
*   **Iterative Implementation:** Jules executed the plan step-by-step by delegating specific, actionable tasks to a "Worker" agent. These tasks included:
    *   Creating new directory structures.
    *   Adapting core classes that are derived from the fork, to work with the constraints of ArgoCD.
    *   Implementing exception handling.
    *   Implementing API classes (e.g., `Sessions.php`, `Accounts.php`) with methods corresponding to ArgoCD API operations.
      * Interaction with these methods should be like [KnpLabs/php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).
    * Any other validation is done through the parameter resolver like in [KnpLabs/php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).
*   **Feedback Incorporation:** The human developer provided feedback at various stages (e.g., on directory structure, PHP version constraints), and Jules updated the plan and execution accordingly.

## Acknowledgements

*   The initial structure and patterns were derived from the excellent [KnpLabs/php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api) library.
*   The target API is [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and its OpenAPI specification was used as the blueprint for API implementation.
  * You can find the OpenAPI spec in `reference/argocd_swagger.json`.
