# PHP GitHub API

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api.png)](http://travis-ci.org/KnpLabs/php-github-api)

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for GitHub API, written with PHP5.

Uses [GitHub API v3](http://developer.github.com/v3/). The object API is very similar to the RESTful API.

## Features

* Follows PSR-0 conventions and coding standard: autoload friendly
* Light and fast thanks to lazy loading of API classes
* Extensively tested and documented

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.2 with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension,
* [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) library,
* (optional) PHPUnit to run tests.

## Autoload

The new version of `php-github-api` using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
The first step to use `php-github-api` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then we have to install our dependencies using:
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```
Now we can use autoloader from Composer by:

```yaml
{
    "require": {
        "knplabs/github-api": "*"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev"
}
```

> `php-github-api` follows the PSR-0 convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate `php-github-api` classes loading in your own autoloader.

## Basic usage of `php-github-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Github\Client();
$repositories = $client->api('user')->repositories('ornicar');
```

From `$client` object, you can access to all GitHub.
